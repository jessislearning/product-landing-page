🏩 Our product is a one-bedroom staycation unit located in Quezon City, Philippines <br>
🤍 The page features an "About", "Amenities" and "Book your stay" sections<br>
📋 It features a pseudo-booking form that submits to a freeCodeCamp static page<br>
🎥 A video element is embedded<br>
⭐️ The page is made responsive by a media query that adjusts the navigation bar and booking form to fit the screen correctly<br>
<br>
A preview of the page is shown in the image below:<br>
